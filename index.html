			    <h2>Just a little about the history of our Church...</h2>
			    <br/>
			    <p>"In the beginning" the church's formation was on a small scale, inspired by the desire of a few neighbors to establish an Episcopal church in the developing residential district near the university, an area called Brooklyn at the time. Dean Milnor Roberts of the College of Mines at the UW was a founding member.</p>
			    <br/>
			    <p>Travel between Seattle and Brooklyn was by boat or railroad until David Denny built the Latona Bridge in 1891.  This hand-operated drawbridge carried horse-drawn traffic and streetcar tracks which extended north. The university moved from downtown Seattle in 1895 and the streetcar station nearest to the campus was called "University Station" at 42nd & 14th (now University Way).  The 1900 census listed about 400 people in the Brooklyn Addition.  Among them were the founding families of Christ Church. </p>
			    <br/>
			    <p>Col. J. N. Gilmer and family moved to E 45th & 15th NE in March 1903.  The family found it difficult to attend the nearest Episcopal church, so with neighbors they founded "the mission at University Station,"  named All Saints.  The name was later changed to Christ Church to avoid confusion with another All Saints parish in the diocese.</p>
			    <br/>
			    <p>At first they shared space with the Baptists in a hall over the drugstore at 14th NE & E 42nd.  The Rev. Dr. G. Clement King, first vicar, who trained in carpentry as part of his missionary preparations in Scotland, undertook the construction of a wood frame chapel with the aid of parishioners in 1906.  The church was dedicated on Nov. 1, 1906</p>
			    <br/>
			    <p>The Rev. Willis Stone was rector from 1909-1921. During his tenure the congregation founded Hyland Hall for Episcopal women students at the university.  Dr. Herbert Gowen, head of the Dept. of Oriental Studies at the UW was a significant member of the Christian Education program at Christ Church. He spoke at the church's 50th Anniversary. The church moved from mission status to a parish in 1912.</p>
			    <br/>
			    <p>Hyland Hall—“On October 19, 1910, a beautiful home, thoroughly equipped for the accommodation of sixteen young women of the University of Washington, was established by All Saints’ Church [later Christ Church] under the name of Hyland Hall. The purpose of this organization is to maintain a high standard of excellence in the life of University women, and to create an atmosphere conducive to the attainment of perfect womanhood. As an average there have been fifteen young ladies in the Hall. So many more applications have been received, however, that the Board of trustees hopes in the near future to obtain a building which will accommodate 25 women.” —1911 Annual Report.</p>
			    <br/>
			    <p>In 1914 the chapel was moved next door to act as the parish hall, and the current church was built on the corner of NE 47th & Brooklyn NE. In 1921 the young women of Hyland Hall paid off the remaining $1,000 mortgage of the church in memory of its rector, the Rev. W. H. Stone.</p>
			    <br/>
			    <p>The Rev. Paul Boynton James was rector from 1922-1942.  He was also appointed student chaplain at the university in 1922.  His scholarship attracted professors from the UW including Prof. William Wilson and Dr. Frederick Padelford, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. During the Depression, the parish hall was donated to the YMCA for a gymnasium and moved to 12th NE. The church was moved to the next lot south and the corner was leased to Shell Oil for a gas station to help stabilize church income. However, lean times and disaffection with Boynton's high church orientation reduced membership and finances to a critical level.</p>
			    <br/>
			    <p>Boynton died in 1942 and the church was without leadership for two years.  However, the Rev. Lewis James Bailey revived university involvement during his tenure from 1944-1948.  Canterbury Club was created with the Rev. David Cochran as chaplain. The diocese bought a house for him and his family; students were welcome there for tea, supper, discussions and social gatherings.  Gatherings were also held in the "undercroft" or basement of the church, and an office and lounge were added for their use when Church House was built in 1954.</p>
			    <br/>
			    <p>Canterbury Club was later moved to Covenant House, closer to campus, and is now Episcopal Crossroads.</p>
			    <br/>
			    <p>Community concern:  "The campus in those days (1960s) was not immune to the life beyond its borders. I remember accompanying Bishop William Lewis, Canon Rudy Devik and students to a civil rights rally in Seattle. Students were returning from voter registration trips to the South.” The Rev. Jacob (Jake) Beck, Canterbury Chaplain from 6-62 to 6-64.  Christ Church has been involved in Neighbors in Need, Teen Feed, University Churches Emergency Fund and the founding of the Emergency Feeding Program. We have participated in the annual AIDS Walk and been part of AIDS Care teams. Deacon Mary Shehane, who has been the chaplain to Canterbury (now Episcopal Crossroads) founded the Sanctuary Art Center while at Christ Church.  Currently, Christ Church houses a SHARE (Seattle Housing & Resource Effort) indoor shelter for 30 men on a nightly basis, and provides a monthly meal at the Orion Center downtown.</p>
			    <br/>
			    <p>Christ Church continues to offer itself as a parish home to students and staff of the University of Washington as well as the University District as a whole. We are partners with other local churches in the University District Ecumenical Parish. The Rev. Mary MacKenzie is our Young Adult Missioner interacting with young adults of our community from 18-35, single and married, to address their needs and concerns.</p>
			    <br/>
			    <p>Christ Church celebrated its 108th Anniversary Sunday, Nov. 6, 2011 at the 10 AM service with a Parish potluck brunch and festivities following.  Congratulations to the University of Washington on its 150th Anniversary!</p>
