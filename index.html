			    <h2>A little about the history of our Church...</h2>
			    <p>"In the beginning" the church's formation was on a small scale, inspired by the desire of a few neighbors to establish an Episcopal church in the developing residential district near the university, an area called Brooklyn at the time. Dean Milnor Roberts of the College of Mines at the UW was a founding member.</p>
			    <br/>
			    <p>Travel between Seattle and Brooklyn was by boat or railroad until David Denny built the Latona Bridge in 1891.  This hand-operated drawbridge carried horse-drawn traffic and streetcar tracks which extended north. The university moved from downtown Seattle in 1895 and the streetcar station nearest to the campus was called "University Station" at 42nd & 14th (now University Way).  The 1900 census listed about 400 people in the Brooklyn Addition.  Among them were the founding families of Christ Church. </p>
			    <br/>
			    <p>Col. J. N. Gilmer and family moved to E 45th & 15th NE in March 1903.  The family found it difficult to attend the nearest Episcopal church, so with neighbors they founded "the mission at University Station,"  named All Saints.  The name was later changed to Christ Church to avoid confusion with another All Saints parish in the diocese.</p>
