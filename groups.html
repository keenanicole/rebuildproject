				<br />
				<p>Young Adults Group at Christ Episcopal Church - * Monday night gathering has been discontinued until further notice.</p>
				<br />
				<p>If you are a young adult, ages 18-35, and would like a group that talks about politics, saints & sinners, bible study, movies, and theology - then plan to join us.  
				   Look for the Christ Episcopal Church Young Adults group on Facebook. Questions? Contact the parish office at office@christchurchseattle.org, or call 206-633-1611.</p>
				<br />
				<p>We have experienced one of the realities of young adult ministry; young adults often have to move to pursue academic and/or career opportunities. 
				   This past year, we have had to say goodbye to many of our Monday Night regulars. While we are sorry to see people leave, we celebrate their achievements and our 
				   prayers go with them. I think we have a lot to celebrate in this particular program that served a great group of young adults for three years. 
				   And now it’s time to move on to other ways of doing young adult ministry.</p>
